Web Admin
=========

If you are on an environment which does not provide command-line access (i.e. shared hosting), you can create web_update.php file and paste the following into it assuming PHP is installed and registered on the system $PATH.

    <?php passthru('php update.php');

_Make sure you delete it when you are done._
